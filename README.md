<h3>About me:</h3>
I'm an 21 year old Junior Developer for Ambevtech, currently located in Blumenau Brazil.

I started my career at the beginning of 2019 being part of a 6 month Java Development project where I had the opportunity to 
work with Java Web, as well as SQL, and web development. Currently I'm part of a project structured with microservices patterns and DevOps environment which gives me the opportunity to work with technologies as .NET, Docker, Kubernetes, Azure ServiceBus, Azure DevOps on a daily basis.
