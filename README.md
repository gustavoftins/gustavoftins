<p>
I'm an 18 year old Junior Developer for Ambevtech, currently located in Blumenau Brazil. I started my career at the beginning of 2019 being part of a 6 month Java Development project where I had the opportunity to 
work with Java Web, as well as SQL, and web development. This project eventually led me to have the opportunity to join Ambevtech.
Currently I'm part of a project structured with microservices patterns and DevOps environment that give me the opportunity to work with technologies as Docker, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, Azure DevOps on a daily basis.
